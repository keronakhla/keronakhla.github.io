  <p>
    I'm Kerolos. I likes to design and build beautiful iOS apps.
	my path to becoming an iOS developer was not direct I kind of fell into it. I was a premed student at St. Mary's College of California where I took my first programming class and fell in love with coding and the rest is history...</p>

	<p>I'm passionate about the iOS platform and strive to follow its philosophy of building neat solutions on the inside and out. I care about pixel-perfect design as much as object-oriented code. I enjoy transforming static mock-ups into live and responsive forms especially custom interfaces and innovative UI concepts. My focus at the moment is native iOS development using UIKit but I also have some experience building web based applications with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS using Meteor technologies.</p>

	<p>I'm always looking to find interesting and challenging projects with new technologies, so this doesn’t mean that I’m limited to the technologies mentioned here. </p>

	<p><b>Skills:</b> Git, Github, Command Line, Objective-C, Swift, Xcode, iOS, iOS Development, Parse, Bohemian Coding - Sketch<sup>3</sup>, App Prototyping, Scrum, Lean Startup.</p>
