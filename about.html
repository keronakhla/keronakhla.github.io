  <p>
    I am a passionate fan of the iOS platform and strive to follow its philosophy of building neat solutions on the inside and out. I care about pixel-perfect design as much as object-oriented code. I enjoy transforming static mock-ups into live and responsive forms. I especially enjoy working with custom interfaces and innovative UI concepts. My focus at the moment is native iOS Development using UIKit, SpriteKit or Cocos2D but I also have some experience building web based applications with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS using Meteor technologies.

I am always looking to find interesting and challenging projects with new technologies, so this doesn’t mean that I’m limited to the technologies mentioned here. 

SPECIALTIES: IOS DESIGN & DEVELOPMENT, OBJECTIVE-C, SWIFT, INTERFACE DESIGN, USER EXPERIENCE, PROJECT MANAGEMENT.
