*It depends...*

Your target market will answer that question. Steve Blank on getting out of the building:

Apple's iOS and Google's Android combined own about 90% market share in the smartphone category. Currently Android is dominating the smartphone race in the U.S. with 54% and 43% for iOS according to [comScore](https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Market-Rankings/comScore-Reports-March-2015-US-Smartphone-Subscriber-Market-Share). 

So you're an aspiring entrepreneur who might be limited on resources and don't have the money or time to develop for the platform that might not reap as much crop at least in the beginning stages. Which one do you choose? 

There are three factors you want to consider: 

1. Revenue and visibility

2. Fragmentation

3. Customer usage

**Revenue and visibility**

Right of the bat, from the market share numbers you know you will get more exposure on the Android platform. However, we all know that paying customers are on the App Store. Do you care more about generating revenue or getting more exposure and traction? In my opinion, though, you can still get the same exposure on the App Store if you utilize ASO.

**Fragmentation**

We all know that Android phones come in gazillion screen sizes and developing for those isn't a walk in the park but that's not what fragmentation is just all about. You have to think about software and features. 

Take Airdrop for example, if your app utilizes airdrop then your customers who own an iPhone 4S and lower won't be able to use it. Some features on Android 5.0 Lollipop which require the high end phones like Samsung Galaxy won't work on the lower end phones. 

Knowing which features your app is going to majorly utilize will help you target your customer and their phones. 

**Customer usage**

Which category does your app fall under? For millennial consumers the most popular categories on iOS are sports, health and fitness, followed by music and media. On the Android, however, the most popular are personalization, books, and entertainment.
