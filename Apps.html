			<h3>Mindful Life Project</h3>
			<h5>Empower underserved children through mindfulness and other transformative skills to gain self-awareness, confidence, self-regulation and resilience, leading to lifelong success.</h5>
		</header>
		<p>This application is a resource to anyone, anywhere, who would like to practice and experience the benefits of mindfulness. It also offers a supplement to our regular school day services for classroom teachers, students, schools and families.</p>

		<p>Mindful Life Project is a non-profit 501(c)3 that is based out of Richmond, CA. We teach mindfulness, yoga, therapeutic art and hip-hop/performing arts to elementary students in underserved schools and communities. We have two regular day school programs that teach self-awareness, impulse-control, confidence and resiliency.</p>
